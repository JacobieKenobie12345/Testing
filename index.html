    A sundial is a gadget that you can tell time with. It was one of the <em>first ways to tell time.</em> How it works is when the sun is in different parts of the sky it makes the <span class = "Shadows">shadow</span> from the triangle points to the time on the circle.

    <div id= "side-bar"><h3>Why are some shadows different colors? </h3>
    
    
    <p>The object that the <span class = "Shadows">shadow</span> is from is probobly colored glass. It could also be some other object that light can go through that is colored, like plastic. That is because light can stil go through glass but it can't be the same color because it got changed by the glass or plastic.</p></div> 



    
    <div id = "what-are-shadows" ><h2 >What are <span class = " Shadows">shadows</span>?</h2>
    <p>A <span class = "Shadows">shadow</span> is simply just a place where there is an object in front of a light source. For example if I am camping and I need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I take a flashlight to see where I am going and, all the trees will have <span class = "Shadows">shadows</span> because they are blocking the light. Some of you are probobly wondering why aren't <span class = " Shadows">shadows</span> all of the way black? Well the answer to that question is that light bounces off other things and comes to where the <span class = "Shadows">shadow</span> is. </p></div>
